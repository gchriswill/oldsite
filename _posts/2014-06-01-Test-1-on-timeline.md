Beginning the first post of my timeline, I have to introduce my self first. My name is [Christopher Gonzalez](https://plus.google.com/u/0/103403313099983008189) digitally known as
[gchriswill](https://twitter.com/gchriswill) and I'm a web designer/developer and iOS developer. Currently on my last
academic year at Full Sail University majoring for Mobile Development B.S. based on Winter Park, FL.


Today, I started testing and tweaking my blogging platform with some awesome tools that I never used before.
Since I got introduced to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the engine powering Github Pages, I felt
truly in love with it. At first, I didn't know anything about it nor how to used. Then I had to make some research to adquire
knowledge about this new cool engine. But while researching, I found other cool things that I could integrate to this website,
like the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework. Honestly it hasn't been easy to design and develop alone by my
self integrating so many web technologies and frameworks, but anyway its really starting to look awesome!


I didn't liked the idea for just to make a regular website to sell, advertise, promote or to collect data. Instead, I wanted
to get rid of my old crappy website website and make a new one from scratch based on my own image. This website is just simply
me and all about me, my goals, my projects, my hacks, and my life as a college student. There's not going to be any ads here nor
promotions and definitely I'm NOT going to sell nothing or collect any data. This timeline will be for sharing my self, my thoughts
and my knowledge to the whole world and I hope everyone enjoys it.
